  abstract = {High-resistance exercise training results in an increase in muscle wet mass and protein content. To begin to address the acute changes following a single bout of high-resistance exercise, a new model has been developed. Training rats twice a week for 6 wk resulted in 13.9 and 14.4\% hypertrophy in the extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles, respectively. Polysome profiles after high-resistance lengthening contractions suggest that the rate of initiation is increased. The activity of the 70-kDa S6 protein kinase (p70               S6k               ), a regulator of translation initiation, is also increased following high-resistance lengthening contractions (TA, 363 \textpm{} 29\%; EDL, 353 \textpm{} 39\%). Furthermore, the increase in p70               S6k               activity 6 h after exercise correlates with the percent change in muscle mass after 6 wk of training ( r = 0.998). The tight correlation between the activation of p70               S6k               and the long-term increase in muscle mass suggests that p70               S6k               phosphorylation may be a good marker for the phenotypic changes that characterize muscle hypertrophy and may play a role in load-induced skeletal muscle growth.},

  abstract = {The applications of Western/immunoblotting (               WB               ) techniques have reached multiple layers of the scientific community and are now considered routine procedures in the field of physiology. This is none more so than in relation to skeletal muscle physiology (i.e., resolving the mechanisms underpinning adaptations to exercise). Indeed, the inclusion of               WB               data is now considered an essential aspect of many such physiological publications to provide mechanistic insight into regulatory processes. Despite this~popularity, and due to the ubiquitous and relatively inexpensive availability of               WB               equipment, the quality of               WB               in publications and subsequent analysis and interpretation of the data can be variable, perhaps resulting in spurious conclusions. This may be due to poor laboratory technique and/or lack of comprehension of the critical steps involved in               WB               and what quality control procedures should be in place to ensure robust data generation. The present review aims to provide a detailed description and critique of               WB               procedures and technicalities, from sample collection through preparation, blotting and detection, to analysis of the data collected. We aim to provide the reader with improved expertise to critically conduct, evaluate, and troubleshoot the               WB               process, to produce reproducible and reliable blots.},
